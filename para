This is a simple travel website made with HTML and CSS, called "Travel Explorer". It has a beautiful header section with a background image and title that welcomes visitors. Below that, there is a "Popular Destinations" section showing three famous travel places: Paris, Bali, and New York, each with a picture, name, and a short description.

Then, there's an "About Us" section where the site explains that it helps people explore different places around the world. Finally, there's a "Contact Us" section with an email and phone number, and a footer at the bottom with copyright info and a link to Instagram.
